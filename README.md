# Lab02-ATM

### Description
This is a console based ATM interface. The user is introduced to a menu with 4 options: View Balance, Withdraw, Deposit, and Exit. The user is given a default balance of $9999 and they may add or subtract funds from that balance through the menu prompts. Users may not withdraw more than their balance, and exceptions are handled in a try/catch block around the main menu switch statements.

### User Instructions
From the main menu, choose one of 4 options:
1. View Balance - Displays your current balance.
2. Withdraw - The user will be asked to enter an amount to withdraw and, if funds are available, will subtract the amount and display the new balance.
3. Deposit - The user will be asked to enter an amount to add to their funds and then display the new balance.
4. Exit - This will exit the menu, display a goodbye message, and end the program.
Do not worry about withdrawing more than you have, conditional statements and error handling will prevent this from happening. Also, if you accidentally enter an invalid menu option, you will simply be asked to choose again.
